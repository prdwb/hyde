I was born in Dalian China, a nice city by the sea. I found myself very interested in coding since my senior year in high school, that's why I choose Computer Science and Technology as my major at University. Coding is like playing Lego to me, the sense of accomplishment when finishing a project is indescribable. I am familiar with C/C++, Python, Java, PHP and Android programming. I am particularly passionate about Python, it's a language that makes me focus on what I want to achieve instead of the language per se.

I watched a TED video by Nick Bostrom years ago, in which he says we can expect the advent of Super Artificial Intelligence by 2050, and when it arrives, it will change everything. That's when I find the field I want to dedicate my life to. It's our generation's responsibility.
